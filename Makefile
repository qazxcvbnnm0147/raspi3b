# -nostdlib Don't use the C standard library. 
# -nostartfiles Don't use standard startup files. Startup files are responsible for setting an initial stack pointer, initializing static data, and jumping to the main entry point. 
# -ffreestanding A freestanding environment is an environment in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may not necessarily be at main. The option -ffreestanding directs the compiler to not assume that standard functions have their usual definition.
# -mgeneral-regs-only. Use only general-purpose registers. ARM processors also have NEON registers. We don't want the compiler to use them because they add additional complexity
